A briefing story of me as a gamer...

In 1988, I got a MSX computer and I liked playing games using its cursor keys.
Since then I've always enjoyed playing games of various genres using a PC keyboard. 
...and a mouse in "point and click", FPS and RTS games...
I never got used to playing with game controllers with the design used from the NES to the PS5.
And I never had any of those video game consoles either. 
However, I always researched game controllers that use mechanical keyboard keys.

And i found these designs below:

Based on these designs, I decided to make a version using the PCB of a mega drive controller.
To be used on both a mega drive and an msx computer (with the joymega adapter)

I made a prototype, by hand, using aluminum sheet and plywood.
Inside there is a mega drive 6-buttons game controller PCB connected by wires to Outemu switches.
